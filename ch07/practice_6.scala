// 6) Write a function that reports recent Github commits for a project. 
// Github provides an RSS feed of recent commits for a given user, repository and branch, containing xml that you can parse out with regular expressions. 
// Your function should take the user, repository and branch, read and parse the RSS feed, and then print out the commit information. 
// This should include the date, title and author of each commit.

// You can use the following RSS url to retrieve recent commits for a given repository and branch:

// https://github.com/<user name>/<repo name>/commits/<branch name>.atom
// Here is one way to grab the RSS feed as a single string.

// scala> val u = "https://github.com/scala/scala/commits/2.11.x.atom"
// u: String = https://github.com/scala/scala/commits/2.11.x.atom

// scala> val s = io.Source.fromURL(u)
// s: scala.io.BufferedSource = non-empty iterator

// scala> val text = s.getLines.map(_.trim).mkString("")
// text: String = <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><feed xmlns=...
// Working with the xml will be a bit tricky. You may want to use +text.split(<token>) to split the text into the separate <entry> components, and then use regular expression capture groups (see [regular_expressions_section]) to parse out the <title> and other elements. 
// You could also just try iterating through all the lines of the xml file, adding elements to a buffer as you find them, and then converting that to a new list.

// Once you have completed this exercise (and there is a lot to do here), here are some additional features worth investigating. 
// a) Move the user, repo and branch parameters into a tuple parameter. 
// b) Following exercise "a", have the function take a list of Github projects and print a report of each oneâ€™s commits, in order of specified project. 
// c) Following exercise "b", retrieve all of the projects commit data concurrently using futures, await the result (no more than 5 seconds), and then print a commit report for each project, in order of project specified. 
// d) Following exercise "c", mix the commits together and sort by commit date, then print your report with an additional "repo" column.

// These additional features will take some time to implement, but are definitely worthwhile for learning and improving your Scala development skills.

// Once you have finished these features, test out your commit report using entries from the following projects.

// https://github.com/akka/akka/tree/master
// https://github.com/scala/scala/tree/2.11.x
// https://github.com/sbt/sbt/tree/0.13
// https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz/tree/series/7.2.x
// These features are all active (as of 2014), so you should see an interesting mix of commit activity in your report. 
// Its worthwhile to browse the repositories for these core open source Scala projects, or at least their documentation, to understand some of the excellent work being done.
